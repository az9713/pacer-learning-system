Intro
0:00
in this video I'll teach you a system
0:01
for remembering everything you read
0:04
study or learn I've been using the
0:06
system for the last 7 years starting
0:09
from learning disease pathophysiology in
0:11
medical school through to reading
0:13
research articles and learning science
0:16
or reading books on productivity or
0:18
business and the reason the system works
0:20
so consistently and so well is because
0:23
it breaks down that process of reading
0:24
into two distinct stages the first stage
Stages of Reading
0:28
is the consumption
0:31
period and the second stage is the
0:34
digestion
0:36
period most people think that by
0:38
focusing on the first stage and
0:40
consuming more information they'll be
0:42
able to therefore remember and apply
0:45
more information so they focus on trying
0:47
to read faster or watching lectures at
0:49
triple speed or binge listening to audio
0:51
books or watching hours of YouTube
0:53
tutorials but that is not how learning
0:56
works and once we understand how
0:58
learning does work you'll see why my
1:01
system is so effective you see when it
1:03
comes to remembering and applying
1:05
information it's much less about what
1:08
comes in to your brain and it's much
1:10
more about how much stays in your brain
1:14
and that is what the second stage the
1:16
digestion period is all about and it's
1:19
the part that is often neglected so
1:21
teach you a system for mastering both of
1:23
these stages which in turn increases
1:26
your Aurora retention as well as your
1:29
ability to actually use the knowledge in
1:31
the way that you need to but first we
1:33
need to ask ourselves is it even
1:36
possible to remember everything you read
1:39
and the short answer is no but here's
1:43
the secret trying to remember everything
1:47
we read should not be the goal in the
1:51
first place and we know this because of
1:53
a man who actually could remember
1:55
everything this man's name is Kim Peak
1:58
and his story is so crazy that Hollywood
2:00
made an entire movie about him Kim Peak
2:03
was a mega genius and his memory was
2:06
ridiculous he was able to memorize a
2:09
book with such perfect recall that after
2:11
reading a book one time he would be able
2:15
to write it out word for word with every
2:19
comma and full stop back to front he
2:23
memorized so many maps and atlases that
2:26
he could give you driving directions
2:28
between any two cities in the world and
2:30
the path that he gave you was mentally
2:33
calculated to be the shortest distance
2:35
now the reason K had such supernatural
2:37
abilities is because of a very rare
2:39
medical condition he had called FG
2:41
syndrome he was born with macroy which
2:44
means he had a larger brain and he had
2:47
no Corpus colossum which is basically
2:49
the bundle of neurons that connect both
2:52
hemispheres of the brain together in
2:53
scientists believe that because he
2:54
didn't have the normal pattern of
2:56
neurons his brain adapted and developed
2:59
Ved new connections to compensate which
3:02
I guess gave him like superhuman memory
3:05
now I want you to imagine that both you
3:07
and Kim Peak were about to sit the same
3:09
exam who do you think would do better
3:12
and the answer is that it actually
3:14
depends on the exam you see despite his
3:17
superhuman memory Kim Peak struggled
3:20
with reasoning and problem solving which
3:23
means that if the exam was at the junior
3:26
levels of schooling which often tests on
3:28
the lower levels of of learning which
3:30
involve a lot of memorization and recall
3:33
then Kim Peak would definitely win but
3:35
if the exam was at a higher level like
3:37
University or postgraduate where the
3:40
reasoning and problem solving the higher
3:43
orders of learning are examined as a
3:46
higher priority then you may actually
3:49
have the edge now for most of you
3:51
listening probably using the knowledge
3:53
you have consumed to reason and problem
3:56
solve is kind of the whole point of why
3:58
you're trying to read and remember in
4:00
the first place which basically means
4:02
that it is not enough to remember
4:06
everything which is good because for
4:08
most people that's not possible anyway
4:10
but it is possible to remember
4:13
everything you need to remember in such
4:16
a way that we can use that knowledge in
4:20
the way we need to and that is what the
4:22
system that I'll teach you helps you to
4:24
achieve so to start using the system we
4:27
have to understand that not all
4:29
information is equal in fact I break
4:32
down the information that I read into
4:34
five different categories using the
4:36
acronym
PACER System
4:38
Pacer and it's important to be able to
4:40
identify which category the information
4:43
you're reading to belongs to because for
4:45
each category there are specific
4:48
targeted processes that then help you to
4:51
deal with and manage that information
4:53
more effectively and when we use the
4:55
wrong process for the specific category
4:58
of information it makes remembering and
5:01
understanding what you read much harder
5:04
much more timec consuming and much less
5:06
effective and that you're more likely to
5:08
forget what you read it also increases
5:10
the chance of you entering the passive
5:12
mode of reading which is where you get
5:14
to the bottom of a page and you can't
5:15
even remember what you just read so the
5:18
system goes like this in the first part
5:20
where we are consuming information we
5:23
want to identify which category what we
5:27
are consuming belongs to using the Pacer
5:31
acronym then during stage two we digest
5:35
what we have read using the targeted
5:38
process for that category which takes
5:41
the information and stores it in our
5:43
long-term memory through the process
5:45
called encoding so let's go through
5:47
Pacer together so that you can
5:49
accurately identify the category of
5:51
information you're trying to remember
Procedural
5:53
the p and Pacer stands for
5:57
procedural and procedural information is
5:59
any information that tells you how
6:02
something should be executed for example
6:05
this is a book that I used during
6:06
medical school that taught me about how
6:09
to do a clinical examination like listen
6:11
to a heartbeat or take someone's blood
6:13
pressure and a lot of the information in
6:15
this book is about the correct technique
6:18
to perform the examination and some
6:20
subjects and domains have a lot of
6:23
procedural information some great
6:25
examples of this would be coding and
6:27
languages the targeted process for
6:29
working with with and mastering this
6:31
type of procedural information is
6:34
practice the key is that you want to
6:37
apply procedural information in real
6:40
life as early as possible a lot of
6:43
people will spend time to read it and
6:45
memorize it and write lots of notes
6:47
about it and then a week or two later
6:49
they'll try to practice it but by then
6:52
it's too late we've already forgotten a
6:53
lot of it and a lot of that time is just
6:56
wasted instead as soon as you take that
6:58
procedural information into your brain
7:01
try to apply it and practice it as early
7:03
as you can now straight away we run into
7:07
a problem with using this approach what
7:10
if we're reading something and we don't
7:12
have time to practice it right now the
7:14
answer is you either move on to
7:17
something else or you stop consuming
7:21
anything and you wait until you have
7:24
time to practice it but you do not waste
7:26
your time trying to just memor memorize
7:29
it on the spot because here is the
7:31
crucial part about learning that
7:33
everyone overlooks the two stages of
7:36
consuming and digesting must always be
7:43
balanced everything you consume must be
7:46
digested in order for you to retain and
7:49
use it only when stage one is followed
7:53
by stage two does learning actually
7:57
occur if we're reading something and we
7:59
don't have time time to use the right
8:00
process like practice then most people
8:02
will say oh well I don't have time right
8:04
now I'm just going to get through as
8:06
much of it as I can and they spend more
8:08
time reading and reading and essentially
8:10
just consuming more and more but this is
8:14
the learning equivalent of overeating
8:16
they haven't had a chance to digest it
8:17
so they're just going to end up vomiting
8:19
it all up again through the mental
8:22
vomiting process we call forgetting
8:23
which is why for most people the amount
8:26
that they forget after reading is
8:28
extremely high with some studies
8:31
suggesting that up to
8:33
90% of what is consumed is forgotten
8:37
despite hours of consuming and if we're
8:40
forgetting 90% of what we read rather
8:43
than consuming more and taking time away
8:47
from the digesting it actually makes
8:49
more sense to spend less time consuming
8:53
and more time on the digesting and
8:56
processing this increases your retention
8:59
with which therefore increases the
9:02
amount of working knowledge you're able
9:04
to build so earlier I said what goes
9:07
into your brain is less important than
9:09
what stays in your brain and this
9:11
principle of balancing stage one
9:13
consuming with stage two digesting is
9:16
important not just for procedural
9:18
information but for every other category
9:21
of PESA unfortunately stage two
9:24
digesting is almost completely neglected
9:27
for the second category of in the a of
Analogous
9:30
Pacer which stands for
9:35
analogous analogous information is
9:37
actually one of the easiest types of
9:40
information to work with and remember
9:43
and apply because analogous information
9:47
is the information that is related to
9:50
something you already have prior
9:53
knowledge about and even if we don't
9:55
have direct prior knowledge about it it
9:58
may remind us indirectly of something
10:01
that we do have knowledge about for
10:03
example let's say that we are an avid
10:05
swimmer and we're learning about the
10:08
physiology of a muscle contraction when
10:10
we look at that muscle contraction cycle
10:13
we might think hey that reminds me a lot
10:16
about the swimming technique I use and
10:19
by connecting the new information about
10:22
muscle contraction physiology with what
10:25
we already know our swimming technique
10:28
we have created
10:29
an analogy and so that is analogous
10:32
information and analogies can form with
10:35
any prior knowledge including knowledge
10:38
within a topic itself in most fields of
10:41
study there are Concepts or patterns of
10:44
Concepts and relationships that tend to
10:47
repeat and recur throughout that field
10:50
you might have learned about how to
10:51
solve a particular type of problem last
10:53
semester and now this semester this new
10:56
problem solving approach that you're
10:57
learning for the first time reminds you
10:59
a lot of that old problem solving
11:02
process and relating those two
11:04
approaches is also an analogy so when
11:06
we're engaging in stage one the
11:09
consumption period of reading we want to
11:12
actively be thinking about whether what
11:14
we are reading is related to something
11:18
that we already have knowledge about and
11:20
once we identify it as potentially
11:22
analogous information the targeted
11:25
process we want to use here is critique
11:30
this is the part I said everyone misses
11:32
once we create an analogy critiquing it
11:36
means we examine critically how good
11:39
that analogy actually is for example
11:42
with the analogy of muscle contraction
11:44
and swimming technique critiquing that
11:46
analogy means asking ourselves in what
11:49
way specifically are these two things
11:52
similar or related to each other in what
11:55
ways are they different in what
11:58
situation does this analogy not make
12:00
sense anymore and if there are a lot of
12:02
differences or a lot of conditions and
12:04
situations where the analogy breaks
12:06
apart then is there a better analogy or
12:09
can we extend or modify that analogy to
12:12
make it more comprehensive and more
12:14
accurate this critiquing process
12:16
massively drives up our attention and
12:19
depth of understanding of this new
12:21
information and the reason this works is
12:23
because instead of new information just
12:25
being new information that your brain
12:28
doesn't know what to do with we're
12:29
actually extending it from what we
12:32
already know we're taking our existing
12:34
Network and connecting it to the new
12:37
information straight away which is the
12:39
reason why creating analogies has been
12:41
shown in studies repeatedly to be so
12:44
powerful for our retention and
12:46
understanding now at this point you
12:47
might be looking at the system and
12:49
thinking this seems a little forced it
12:52
doesn't feel natural and you're right in
12:54
fact it's crucial that you understand
12:57
that this is not natural and that's why
13:01
it works if you have no time pressure
13:04
and it doesn't matter how well you learn
13:06
something then you can learn and read
13:08
however you want but unfortunately what
13:11
research has shown is that there are
13:13
clear biological limitations of the
13:16
human brain to how much it can consume
13:19
and store into our memory in one go and
13:22
in the modern day when there is so much
13:24
we have to learn it is very very easy to
13:28
exceed that biological limit and then
13:30
get overwhelmed learning is extremely
13:33
complicated so to be able to learn a lot
13:36
in a short amount of time reach a high
13:37
level of knowledge a lot of processes
13:40
need to go right and this is why most
13:43
people will Plateau on their learning
13:45
ability and after a point not really
13:48
improve for the rest of their lives for
13:50
me figuring out what processes to care
13:52
about and therefore what to improve on
13:55
and then how to even execute on those
13:59
correctly took me at least 7 or 8 years
14:02
of almost constant experimentation and
14:06
reading of research and coaching people
14:09
to see what works for them and honestly
14:11
I got lucky because 10 15 years ago a
14:13
lot of the research didn't even exists
14:15
which is why to make it easier for you
14:18
I've started a free Weekly Newsletter I
14:21
take everything that I've learned that
14:23
helps you become a more efficient
14:24
learner the things that have the highest
14:26
chance of giving you success in a short
14:29
amount of time and I packaged them in a
14:31
way that you can take and Implement into
14:34
your own learning in less than 10 15
14:36
minutes if you want to sign up to the
14:37
newsletter it's completely free I'll
14:38
leave a link in the description for you
14:40
now getting back to peser you might
14:42
notice that the way that I've written
14:44
the a in PESA is is like this it's this
14:48
kind of strange shape there the reason
14:50
is because a the analogous information
14:54
can exist within as a subset of
14:59
procedural information for example you
15:01
could create an analogy on a set of
15:04
instructions to make it simpler and
15:06
easier for you to understand and then
15:07
later you go and practice it but
15:09
analogous information also exists as a
15:11
subset within the next category of
15:14
information which is the C of Paca and
15:17
this stands for
Conceptual
15:19
conceptual if procedural information is
15:22
the how to do something then conceptual
15:25
information is the what and for most
15:27
science subjects the majority of what
15:29
you need to learn is conceptual
15:31
conceptual information includes facts
15:33
and explanations theories and principles
15:37
relationships between Concepts and ways
15:40
that that concept can be applied and in
15:42
most cases we need both the procedural
15:44
and the conceptual knowledge to solve a
15:47
problem and apply our knowledge properly
15:49
for example although this book goes
15:51
through how to listen to someone's heart
15:55
I still need to have the conceptual
15:58
knowledge about what I'm listening to to
16:00
be able to analyze that and make a
16:02
conclusion on the diagnosis so when we
16:05
identify that a piece of text we're
16:06
reading is conceptual type information
16:09
the process we want to use straight away
16:11
is
16:13
mapping
16:14
nonlinear network based note taking such
16:18
as mind mapping is an efficient way of
16:21
increasing your attention and Mastery of
16:24
conceptual knowledge because conceptual
16:26
knowledge inherently exists in a network
16:29
although a textbook or a lecture might
16:31
be delivered word after word in a linear
16:34
format if we look at the mind and
16:37
knowledge of the person that wrote that
16:39
textbook it doesn't exist in a linear
16:43
sentence by sentence structure their
16:45
knowledge and expertise exists in a
16:47
highly connected network of information
16:51
there is no innate sequence of
16:53
information an expert can start at any
16:56
point and navigate to any other point
16:59
this is what allows an expert to do
17:01
complex problem solving because they can
17:03
look at a problem understand what
17:05
concepts are related and see how those
17:08
Concepts connect together to solve the
17:11
problem whereas a beginner who's only
17:12
learned it at a surface level just sees
17:15
individual separated Concepts and they
17:18
don't understand how they link together
17:21
as a learner our job is not to remember
17:24
the sequence word for word our job is to
17:26
try to recreate that network of
17:30
knowledge that the expert had and
17:31
mapping is such a great technique
17:33
because it forces us to not only think
17:36
about each fact and concept but also how
17:39
they connect to each other to form a
17:42
bigger picture so when you are reading
17:44
and consuming take some time to get out
17:48
a piece of paper or a tablet and make a
17:51
map of the things that you're learning
17:53
and as you read more you add more to
17:57
your map you move things around you
17:59
reorganize things as you read more you
18:03
also digest more and your map grows
18:06
remember analogous information can also
18:09
exist within conceptual information so
18:12
you might find Opportunities within
18:14
conceptual information to create some
18:16
analogies and you might want to add
18:18
those into your map as well even if the
18:20
analogy doesn't make its way into the
18:21
map it could give you an idea in terms
18:23
of how you want to structure your ideas
18:26
on your map now here's that same problem
18:28
again let's say you reading but you
18:30
don't have time to draw a map or maybe
18:33
you don't have anything to map on while
18:35
you're reading then again we need to
18:37
slow down and consume less so that
18:40
consumption and digestion can stay
18:42
balanced and if you don't you'll just
18:45
end up overwhelmed again and wasting
18:47
time because not only are you going to
18:50
forget a lot of what you are consuming
18:53
but now you've given the future version
18:55
of you more work to do by having to go
18:57
and figure out what your forgotten and
18:59
then Rec consume it again anyway now the
19:02
good news is that the digesting of
19:04
procedural analogous and conceptual
19:06
information is easily the most timec
19:09
consuming the E and the r of PESA are
19:12
much faster and easier to deal with I
19:14
talk about e and are together because
19:15
they're both very similar to each other
19:18
but pay close attention because the two
19:20
are actually so similar to each other
19:23
that most people never distinguish
19:26
between the two and that can lead
19:28
directly to hours of wasted time per
19:31
week the E and Pacer stands for
Evidence
19:35
evidence evidence type information is
19:37
the information that helps make
19:40
conceptual information more concrete
19:43
they're often very detailed sometimes
19:45
very technical pieces of information but
19:48
they're useful because we can use these
19:51
facts or statistics or cases as examples
19:55
to prove a conceptual point for example
19:58
we could understand
20:00
conceptually how World War I started but
20:04
we also need to know the evidence
20:06
information of date certain specific
20:09
events occurred between which specific
20:12
people at which specific location to
20:15
make that concept more concrete and the
20:18
key process for evidence type
20:20
information is to
20:22
store and
20:25
rehearse store means that you just colle
20:28
collect that information and note it
20:30
down somewhere you could add it to your
20:33
conceptual map you could add it to a
20:35
second brain system using something like
20:37
notion or Rome or obsidian or you can
20:40
put it onto flashcards you could even
20:43
just write them down on a document
20:45
somewhere with all the other things that
20:46
you are storing this should happen as
20:48
soon as you identify it so as you are
20:51
consuming the information and you
20:53
identify that this piece of information
20:56
is an Evidence type we go ahead and
20:59
straight away store it the rehearsing
21:02
part of it comes a little later we put
21:05
aside time to do the rehearsal and
21:07
rehearsing the information is the key to
21:11
improving our retention of evidence type
21:13
information rehearsing means that we
21:15
think about how we will need to use this
21:19
piece of information how are we going to
21:21
apply it what type of conceptual
21:23
information is this an example of we
21:25
then challenge ourselves by using an
21:28
applying that information in the way
21:30
that we will need to use it this means
21:33
solving problems or writing detailed
21:35
answers to questions or creating
21:36
explanations teaching it to other people
21:39
or maybe writing essays that use that
21:41
piece of evidence as a supporting
21:44
example for a wider concept and so while
21:46
we store the information while we
21:49
consume it the rehearsing happens later
21:52
maybe at the end of the day or at the
21:53
end of the week but do not waste time
21:57
while you are cons assuming trying to
22:00
just memorize and read and reread and
22:03
writing copious notes on that piece of
22:05
information otherwise you are not going
22:07
to have enough time for the PA and C the
22:11
first three types of information which
22:13
is what forms the foundation of
22:16
knowledge that the evidence type needs
22:19
to build off of in the first place now
22:22
evidence type information is very
22:24
similar to the final type which is the r
22:26
of PESA and this stands for
Reference
22:29
reference type information reference
22:31
information is the easiest to deal with
22:34
it is all of the Nitty Gritty very
22:37
specific detailed bits of information
22:40
that don't really change your conceptual
22:44
understanding they're not particularly
22:47
that important they're not analogous and
22:49
they're not procedural but for whatever
22:51
reason we might need to know this later
22:55
this might be something like the exact
22:56
value of a mathematical con Conant or a
22:59
specific Gene involved in a particular
23:01
mutation or the name of a very specific
23:03
molecule of a disease or maybe a list of
23:06
attributes used to define a variable for
23:09
coding and the process we use to deal
23:12
with this type of information is the
23:13
same as for evidence almost it's store
23:18
and rehearse the same
23:21
things the storing part exactly the same
23:25
you Chuck it in a second brand and your
23:26
flash cards wherever makes sense for you
23:29
but if you need to be able to record
23:30
this information from memory and you
23:32
can't like refer back to your notes when
23:35
you need to use it then you probably
23:36
want to use something like flash cards
23:38
because the rehearse part is a little
23:40
different because reference type
23:42
information is by definition not very
23:46
conceptually important anyway it's quite
23:49
hard to use this for problem solving or
23:52
as part of like an extended discussion
23:54
or answer the way we're probably going
23:56
to use this information is just Direct
23:58
fact recoil which is why something like
24:01
flash cards using a space repetition
24:03
active recoil strategy like an app like
24:06
ankey is going to be the best way to
24:08
handle reference type information so as
24:11
you're reading and you're thinking hey
24:13
this might be a reference type
24:14
information you dump it into your
24:17
flashcards and you put aside like 30
24:20
minutes every day or whatever to just go
24:22
through your flash cards to do your
24:24
rehearsal but please again
24:26
absolutely do not waste time while
24:30
you're reading trying to just read and
24:32
reread and write notes and just memorize
24:34
this information at the time you need to
24:37
use that time for the first three which
24:40
forms the bulk of your knowledge as I
24:43
said earlier there are a lot of things
24:45
that need to go right to be able to
24:47
learn a lot of information in a short
24:49
period of time and wasting time on
24:52
trying to memorize reference information
24:54
while you are reading it instead of
24:56
spending that time on the first three
24:59
types is one of the worst offenders and
25:02
as soon as you get into that mind frame
25:04
of reading something and then rereading
25:07
it again trying to get it into your head
25:09
you can say goodbye to your learning
25:11
efficiency so now you know the five
Putting it all together
25:13
types of information for you to try to
25:15
identify as you consume in stage one and
25:19
the appropriate targeted process that
25:21
will help you to digest that information
25:23
in stage two and the key to be able to
25:26
retain a lot and have a good high level
25:29
of knowledge for what you have consumed
25:31
is to keep that stage one and stage two
25:33
balanced however when it comes to
25:35
learning efficiently this just scratches
25:38
the surface in fact if you look at this
25:41
map of learning that outlines the major
25:44
processes that you need to be a
25:46
consistently High performing efficient
25:49
learner what we talked about today is
25:51
like barely a few percent of it so if
25:54
you want to start unpacking what those
25:55
other processes look like without having
25:57
to dedicate
25:59
a decade of your life to uh learning
26:01
about it like I did then make sure to

in the description thank you so much for
