The system is called **PACER**.

Host **Justin Sung** argues that learning fails because people focus entirely on **Consumption** (Stage 1) while neglecting **Digestion** (Stage 2). Without digestion, information is "mentally vomited" (forgotten).

The PACER system categorizes information into five types, each requiring a specific digestion protocol to encode it into long-term memory.

### **The PACER System**

**1. P - Procedural Information (The "How")**

* **Definition:** Instructions on how to execute a task (e.g., coding syntax, clinical examination techniques).
* **Protocol:** **Practice immediately.** Do not write notes. If you cannot apply it instantly, stop reading until you can. Memorizing steps without execution is a waste of cognitive load.

**2. A - Analogous Information (The "Like")**

* **Definition:** Information that resembles a pattern or concept you already possess in your existing knowledge base.
* **Protocol:** **Critique.** Do not just accept the analogy. Rigorously analyze it: "How is X exactly like Y? Where does the comparison fail?" This critical friction binds the new information to your existing high-strength neural pathways.

**3. C - Conceptual Information (The "What")**

* **Definition:** The core theoretical framework, principles, and abstract relationships. This is the bulk of academic learning.
* **Protocol:** **Mapping.** Linear notes are useless here. You must use non-linear mind maps to reconstruct the expert's semantic network, explicitly linking separated concepts to form a "big picture" architecture.

**4. E - Evidence (The "Proof")**

* **Definition:** Concrete data, case studies, or statistics that validate a concept.
* **Protocol:** **Store & Rehearse (Application).** Offload this to a "Second Brain" (e.g., Notion, Obsidian). Do not memorize it during reading. Later, "rehearse" by using the evidence to solve a specific problem or construct an argument.

**5. R - Reference (The "Minutiae")**

* **Definition:** Arbitrary data with low conceptual value, such as specific dates, constants, or biological names.
* **Protocol:** **Store & Rehearse (Flashcards).** This is low-priority data. Dump it immediately into a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) like Anki. Never waste mental energy trying to memorize this during the consumption phase.

**Summary of the Rule:**
You must balance **Consumption** with **Digestion**. If you read for an hour, you must allocate time to the specific protocol (Practice, Critique, Map, or Store) immediately. If you just read without the protocol, retention drops to near zero.
